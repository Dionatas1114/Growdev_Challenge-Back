# Growdev_Challenge_API

This API is part of the Course Conclusion Work of the [Growdev Starter Program](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qea757td5p7zust/certificado.pdf?dl=0) and was developed in January 2021 to test students skills in Node.

## About this API

* `Growdev_Challenge_API` is a REST API built on `Node.js` and `Express.js` that integrates with the `Postgres` database through `sequelize` (ORM). The database is configured and active, so you can use it. I just ask you not to delete the data in it.

* The access control follows `Bearer Token` spec with the help of `Jsonwebtoken` and `Bcryptjs`.
