# Growdev_Challenge_API

This API is part of the Course Conclusion Work of the [Growdev Starter Program](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qea757td5p7zust/certificado.pdf?dl=0) and was developed in January 2021 to test students skills in Node.

## Overview

1. **Attention**: The database is configured and active, so you can use it. I just ask you not to delete the data in it.

2. **About this API**: `Growdev_Challenge_API` is a REST API built on `Node.js` and `Express.js` that integrates with the `Postgres` database through `sequelize` (ORM). The access control follows `Bearer Token` spec with the help of `Jsonwebtoken` and `Bcryptjs`.

3. **Content and structure**: This API contains models
* Models:
  1.User
  2.Class
  3.Growdever
  4.ClassUser
* Controllers
  1.UserController
  2.ClassController
  3.AuthController
  4.GrowdeverController
* Middleware: auth
* routes: public and private
* database Postgress

## What I practiced on this API

1.creation of the models with data and their respective types
2.creation of the controllers with CRUD methods
3.creation of the public and private routes
4.creation of the migrations
5.creation of the middleware (auth)
6.configuration of the `Postgres` database and token (expire in)
7.configuration of the `sqlite` to save the tests coverage
8.creation of the http codes, success and error messages
